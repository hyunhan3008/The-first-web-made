		The aim of the game is to get the block to fall into the square hole at the end of each stage.
		There are 33 stages to complete. To move the block around the wolrd, use the left right up and down arrow keys.
		Be careful not to fall off the edges-the level will be restarted if this happens.
		Bridges and switches are located in many levels. The switches are activated when they are pressed down by the block.
		You do not need to stay resting on this switch to keep bridges closed. There aretwo types of switches: 'Heavy' x-shaped ones and 'Soft' round ones. 
		Soft switches are activated when any par of your block presses it. Hard switches require much more pressure, so your block presses it. Hard switchers
		require much more pressure, so your block must be standing on its end to activate it. When activated, each switch may behave differently. Some will swap
		the bridges from open to closed to open each time it is used. Some will only ever make certain bridges open, and activating it again will not
		make it close. Green or red coloured squres will flash to indicate which bridges are being operated. Orange tiles are more fragile than the rest of
		the land. If your block stands up vertically on an orange tile, the tile will give way and your block will fall. Finally there is a third type of 
		switch shaped like this:() It teleport your block to different location, splitting it into two smaller blocks at the same time. These can be controlled
		individually and will rejoin into a normal block when both are placed next to each other. You can select which small block to use at any time 
		by pressing th spacebar. Small block can still operate soft switches, but they aren't big enough to activate heavy switches. Also small blocks
		cannot go through the exit hole-only a complete block can finish the stage. Remeber the passcode for each stage. It is located in the top right conrer.
		You can skip straight back to each stage later on by going to 'load stage' in the main menu and entering the 6 digit level code. This is about how this
		gmae works. If you want to play game click the beneath button. ENJOY!

		The object is to fulfil the day's quota by placing the butterblock shapes on  the board, in  such a way that it covers over 50% of it.
		The shapes can be moved and placed on the board with the mouse. They can also be rotated with the left and right arrow keys.
		Bonuses will be awarded of 'lines' of the board completed, with simultaneous multiple lines yielding even more points.
		Once the quota is met, the round ends and the board is created. Any uncovered spaces are filled by blockers-blocks that cannot be
		included in the quota. The number on them represents how many rounds they will be on the board for. The order of the next five shapes is
		displayed on the right-hand side of the screen. This allows you to plan your moves in advance. Occasionally, 'eraser' verssions of the 
		regular butterblock shapes will appear. They destroy anything they are dropped onto, blockers included. There is also an option to dispose
		of one butterblock shape per round in the trash bim on the far left of th screen. There is a bonus for not using it durin the round.
		The game ends when the quota cannot be filled. Don't let that happen. This was about how to play the game. Good luck and have a fun!
