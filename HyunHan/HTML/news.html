	<h1>History of the puzzle game</h1> 
	<p>Although the genres of games vary, there are only a few areas that existed before the advent of computer games. The puzzle game is a genre with
	a deep history that aroused the humor of mankind long before the medium of the game appeared. A puzzle can be defined as a more advanced form of riddles.
	If a mystery is a primary brain amusement that exists only in a question and answer, a puzzle is a three-dimensional mystery to arrive at an answer in 
	several stages of thinking.<img src="../images/history.jpg" alt="a image of puzzle"> A maze that goes through a lot of roads to find a destination, a picture puzzle that collects sculptures to complete a 
	large picture, a word fill that links a lot of words, and a mathematical puzzle that identifies the meaning of a given number array. Computer puzzle games
	are also divided into many detailed genres, but there is an intersection that 'solves problems based on logical thinking under given rules'. If you only 
	keep this game, any rules and deployment methods here can be called puzzle games. Such a big deal had a great impact on the popularization of puzzle games. 
	For game makers, it is easy to develop because it can be made with only the idea without the harsh technology and huge capital, and the application fields
	are various genres. As for gamers, anyone who understands a simple game rule can adapt to a puzzle game in a short time, and it is a genre that can be 
	recommended the most at the first introduction of a game to a novice.
